-- Review Scheduling

-- When a member indicates that they want to review a link, we just add it to
-- the @link_to_review@ relation. This may change if we ever support multiple
-- review sets. The link review time is set to the current time by default so
-- that it immediately shows up for review (something we want no matter which
-- algorithm we're using).

-- We need to give the user feedback that they've successfully added the link
-- to their review set. For now, we redirect them back to the referrer because
-- we assume it will be the link page (which will then indicate in some way
-- that they're reviewing the link now). However, this is a good candidate for
-- an asynchronous JavaScript call.

  $(execute "INSERT INTO link_to_review (member_no, link_no) \
                                \VALUES ({memberNumber m}, {linkNo})") ?db

-- We need to schedule the next review based on the review algorithm in use.
-- The algorithm needs to know how well the item was remembered. Also, we log
-- the amount of time it took to recall the item. The SM2 algorithm does not
-- use this information (nor any SuperMemo algorithm that I know of), but we
-- may find it useful when analyzing data later.

-- @recallGrade@ is passed as a real number between 0 and 1 to allow for future
-- variations in recall rating (such as fewer choices than 1 through 5 or less
-- discrete options like a slider). 0 indicates complete failure while 1
-- indicates perfect recall.

-- @recallTime@ is the time in milliseconds.

-- All database updates during this process are wrapped in a transaction.

-- There are at least 2 ways to decide which links should be brought up for
-- review first:
--
-- The method that Vocabulink used originally was taking the ones with the
-- oldest target time. They're the ones that have been waiting longest for
-- review, so we should review them first, right? Well, the problem is that you
-- get into a case when too many links are due for review where you spend
-- longer going through and reviewing all the due links before returning to the
-- beginning of the list and starting over again. If the list of links due for
-- review is long enough, it could take weeks to get through the list and a
-- link that was only waiting a few days for review will have been forgotten by
-- the time we get around to it. This breaks the whole principle of spaced
-- repetition as soon as you fall behind enough.

-- The method that Vocabulink now uses is to prioritize links based on when you
-- started learning them. The links that you started learning longest ago come
-- up for review with high priority as soon as they're due. Links you began
-- learning later have to wait until there's time. This way, if the learner
-- gets backed up, at least they're maintaining the links that they've been
-- spending the longest on (and are presumably the most familiar with). This
-- should also have the side effect of reducing the size of the queue faster
-- because links that the learner has been studying longer are likely to have
-- bigger payoff (time until the next review date) if they nail them.
